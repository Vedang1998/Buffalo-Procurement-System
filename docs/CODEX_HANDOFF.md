# Buffalo Procurement OS — Codex Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-08-10T17:10:56Z (UTC)

**Phase numbering:** This handoff follows `procurement/docs/authority/03_REPLIT_BUILD_EXECUTION_PROMPT_v2_1.md`: Phase 3 is catalog reconciliation and Phase 4 is historical ShopifyQL sales backfill/reconciliation.

This is an operational checkpoint, not a replacement for the canonical specification or `procurement/config/rules.toml`. Verify repository and database state again before acting.

## Verified current state

### Repository and tests

- Branch: `main`.
- Phase 4 starting HEAD: `90a6b9ec2469d541ff11cb3716807754fd4edb05` (`Add durable Codex and Claude project handoff`). The Phase 4 checkpoint commit is the commit containing this update; use `git rev-parse HEAD` for its final SHA.
- Test command: `cd procurement && PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
- Post-backfill test result: **142/142 PASS**, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips; unittest time 2.410 seconds, measured wall time 3.181 seconds on 2026-08-10.
- Coverage includes an isolated, fully rolled-back PostgreSQL integration workflow for raw page persistence, interruption durability, mapping/exclusion audit, local aggregate rebuild, restatement, idempotent rerun, durable range resume, conflicting-alias rollback, and independent review of multiple zero-ID identity groups.

### Phase 3 catalog checkpoint

- `CATALOG_SYNC` is **PASS**, last checked `2026-08-10T14:55:53.634178Z`.
- Independently verified ACTIVE Shopify catalog: **1,999 variants**. The unfiltered Shopify-reported count remains 2,003 because it also includes four inactive variants.
- Current variants: 2,049 total = 1,999 `LIVE`/active + 46 `RETIRED_CONFIRMED`/inactive + 4 historical inactive-as-expected (`SEEDED`/inactive, archived in Shopify).
- The 46 retirements remain individually audited. Phase 4 did not change catalog identity or retirement decisions.

### Phase 4 implementation and live run

- ShopifyQL access probe: **PASS** using configured Admin API `2026-07`; store timezone is `America/New_York`. No customer dimensions or Orders API fallback were used.
- Additive migration `procurement/db/006_phase4_sales_backfill.sql` is applied. It adds durable run/chunk/page checkpoints, run-to-fact observations, restatement evidence, complete control fields, and append-only historical-sales review decisions.
- Live run: `d389079c-eabf-49b5-a245-40a207025fd7`, started `2026-08-10T16:44:26.811525Z`, completed `2026-08-10T16:45:59.804015Z`.
- Requested range: **2024-11-28 through 2026-08-10** (current store-local date at execution).
- Coverage: **21/21 date chunks**, **70/70 structurally contiguous pages**, all pages/chunks complete; no parse error, duplicate observation, missing chunk, or coverage gap. Current-code local finalization re-proved page indexes, offsets, terminal-page structure, stored range, and run-creation date evidence without refetching Shopify.
- Durable source: **59,083 source rows = 59,083 unique natural facts**.
- Resolution: **55,971 resolved rows**, **3,112 unresolved rows**, **0 ambiguous rows**, **0 explicitly excluded rows**.
- Owner review queue: **343 unresolved identity groups** ranked by materiality (**341 material**, 2 zero-impact but retained); one group has a SKU-only candidate, which remains evidence only and is not approved.
- Browser review UI: `/procurement/historical-sales/review` (FastAPI route `/historical-sales/review`); JSON: `/procurement/historical-sales/review/items`. Decisions require actor, reason, and `RECONCILIATION_REVIEW_TOKEN`.
- Shopify source totals exactly equal persisted raw totals:
  - net items: **82,501.0000** source = **82,501.0000** raw;
  - net sales: **$1,300,975.14** source = **$1,300,975.14** raw.
- Canonical resolved totals: **78,815.0000 net items** and **$1,231,372.83 net sales**.
- Unresolved totals: **3,686.0000 net items** and **$69,602.31 net sales**; materiality is **3,696.0000 absolute units** and **$72,616.29 absolute sales**.
- Excluded totals: **0 items / $0.00**. There are zero review decisions and zero active historical exclusions at this checkpoint.
- Coverage, source persistence, idempotency, source/raw controls, resolution accounting, and canonical controls all reconcile. The canonical aggregate was rebuilt from this run's durable facts.
- Phase 4 workflow implementation is complete and the initial live fetch is complete, but **Phase 4 is not complete while human identity review and `SALES_BACKFILL` remain outstanding**.

### Current readiness and safety state

| Gate | Current status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CATALOG_SYNC` | `PASS` | Phase 3 catalog remains reconciled. |
| `SALES_BACKFILL` | `FAIL` | 341 material unresolved identity groups (343 total groups) await owner decisions. |
| `VENDOR_RULES` | `FAIL` | Phase not started. |

- PO generation is **disabled**, blocked by `SALES_BACKFILL` and `VENDOR_RULES`; purchase-order count remains zero.
- Shopify remained strictly read-only. Phase 4 stored no customer fields/PII and made zero Shopify writes.
- No automatic historical alias approval or exclusion occurred.

## Historical checkpoint

- Phases 0–2 are complete; the historical seed contains 2,029 identities.
- Pre-retirement Phase 3 had 1,979 exact active historical/current IDs, 20 genuinely new active variants, 46 deleted historical identities, and 4 inactive-as-expected identities.
- Exact lookup plus deterministic continuity review found no credible current counterpart for all 46 deleted identities; human-authorized retirement was executed and audited before the successful post-retirement catalog sync.

## Authorization boundary / next action

Stop for owner decisions. The only next Phase 4 operation is authenticated human review of the 343 grouped identities followed by local re-resolution/rebuild through the implemented workflow. Do not auto-map, auto-exclude, refetch Shopify merely to apply local decisions, or force `SALES_BACKFILL`.

Do not begin inventory history, vendor rules, forecasting, pricing ingestion, procurement optimization, or PO generation until the owner explicitly authorizes the next phase.
